Image Classification

to create this project we have used kears which is an API of tensor flow provide by google
I user CIFAR dataset which consist of more than 70000 data.

I split it in 8:2 ratio means 80% of the data for training and 20 % of the data for testing

I created this project on online pltform name google coloaboratory this is an online platform where w can just write code without installing high libraries in your computer
if your system is slow then i would higly recomeend to use this


The code is prettu much self explanatory in data set the label was in the form of integer i named label as cat dog and aeroplane etc
